# Voice-Based Cognitive Decline Detection
## A Proof-of-Concept Analysis

---

## Project Overview

- Objective: Detect cognitive decline indicators using voice analysis
- Methodology: Audio processing and machine learning
- Scope: Proof-of-concept with synthetic data
- Key Features: Speech patterns, pitch, pauses, and spectral analysis

---

## Methodology

1. Data Generation
   - Synthetic test data with controlled variations
   - Three cognitive states: normal, mild, moderate
   - 90 audio samples total

2. Feature Extraction
   - Pitch characteristics
   - Speech rate and pauses
   - Spectral features
   - Energy patterns

---

## Key Findings

### Feature Importance
- Pitch variability (0.276)
- Average pitch (0.268)
- Pause duration variability (0.260)
- Speech rate (0.256)
- Zero crossing rate (0.253)

## Pattern Recognition

### Cluster Analysis
- Cluster 0 (40 samples): Normal speech
- Cluster 1 (26 samples): Moderate impairment
- Cluster 2 (24 samples): Mild impairment

### PCA Results
- 74.76% variance explained
- Clear separation between states

## Clinical Implications

1. Early Detection
   - Objective measures of speech patterns
   - Potential for early intervention

2. Monitoring
   - Longitudinal tracking possible
   - Quantitative assessment

3. Integration
   - Complements traditional assessment
   - Non-invasive approach

---

## Next Steps

1. Validation
   - Real patient data
   - Clinical trials

2. Development
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Mobile application

3. Integration
   - Healthcare systems
   - Research platforms
